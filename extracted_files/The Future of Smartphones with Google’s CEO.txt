00:00:00-00:00:06 Speaker 0: power you kind sir coming all the way from Nottingham this some Dr child to see people
00:00:06-00:00:12 Speaker 1: my son is going to be excited I'm doing this he watched that it is your review is what he cast about Oh my god and he's
00:00:12-00:00:15 Speaker 0: about to show us what the future of small fence looks on the one who
00:00:15-00:00:18 Speaker 1: introduced your videos to me like Mr Bob
00:00:18-00:00:24 Speaker 0: were all curious we've seen ferns drastically changing every single year it all suddenly it seemed like they stopped Konrad's
00:00:24-00:00:27 Speaker 1: I heard you got it and gives this yes yeah we're planning our wedding now
00:00:27-00:00:33 Speaker 0: that's all some upset I traveled halfway across the world to find out from the one person who actually does have the answers soon
00:00:33-00:00:36 Speaker 1: be fine have you watched any of us in our Garcia which is
00:00:36-00:00:39 Speaker 0: a favorite pixel seven broad makes me so
00:00:39-00:00:43 Speaker 1: okay so what we're really interested in is
00:00:43-00:00:46 Speaker 0: the future of this morning googles launched affordable
00:00:46-00:01:03 Speaker 1: friend why it's a good question we are trying to push the frontier of what's possible and end of the dailies or computing devices you're trying to do a lot with them you want to be very productive you want them to entertain you and giving people more functionality in a device they are carrying is what we are trying to do something
00:01:03-00:01:16 Speaker 0: confuses me about football so and I took it here if you look at this one writer and got glass you got components you got glass you will compone as glass composed is this the finished product you got three sets of cameras to displays you can only have used one at once
00:01:16-00:01:59 Speaker 1: is this it it's a good question look I think it will be it for some people the benefits it gives will outweighs some of the trade-offs they have their bigger and buck here though this year we made it thin enough that the front screen almost just like my regular phone I don't feel that trade off and I use it but I love and I can multi-task one to apps I love and I can put it as the tabletops you're actually using a fold I've been testing a fault for a while now I use both thinks I'm like well I'd rather have my regular form that at times I'm like I love what the fall dots so in what kind of situations would you rather have your regular phantom just traveling and I'm busy in a day and all I'm doing is pulling out and quick checking e-mail I'm like well I would rather take a light reform
00:01:59-00:02:06 Speaker 0: but you also see this is like a transitory thing so this isn't the destination this is the journey towards something in the future
00:02:06-00:02:20 Speaker 1: that's right you get this is for people who want to live on that future back right it gives you these amazing capabilities but I do think there's more to be done here yeah in this category as a whole so here are the rules and said why
00:02:20-00:02:27 Speaker 0: I guess for you what is the future of the smarter because I was talked a lot about here is that the future as far as you say more on the software end
00:02:27-00:03:01 Speaker 1: as of theirs to the hardware innovation I think I will will make it so much more natural and include of the interact which will isn't today where the early stages of all of this but just with natural language or when you look at something and you want your phone to understand it that's the direction of their computing will go you've always had humans adapt to computing which is the other way about and ai is what will actually enable computers to actually adapt the humans the baby look and the way we talk us adapting to the interface in a computer you are talking to how
00:03:01-00:03:12 Speaker 0: people have to figure out how to search with it sits right we've learned to type in a really a natural way to get the answers we want where is it's moving towards this meals type of sentences the way you would say them you know we we see this
00:03:12-00:03:29 Speaker 1: this in some emerging markets if we blow and use phones before they do a lot of their queries by voice but they don't have this preconceived notions of how to do it so it's an exciting direction but the inform factor the future version of these forms or a pair of glasses all that is to be played
00:03:29-00:03:33 Speaker 0: up how does that our glasses and stuff relate to kobold's do think that that's
00:03:33-00:03:56 Speaker 1: a direct replacement I don't think so I think you will have a primary computing device and increasingly phone servet for people what we are doing what the folders pushing the boundaries of what a phone can be giving them expanded capable reason in a phone like form factor there'll be other things to go at the phone watch us are one example glasses will be one down the line so you imagine glasses
00:03:56-00:03:59 Speaker 0: as being like an accessory to the third at least preliminary
00:03:59-00:04:09 Speaker 1: battery that is more near-term and like a fully immersive computing device on your head all the time just because of that the state of the technology is today it's really
00:04:09-00:04:13 Speaker 0: hard to imagine right now that being a thing yeah that's right you
00:04:13-00:04:35 Speaker 1: think it's a way off so it depends on a lot of planes today it's good to do this outdoor so yes but you know defensive or what you're really into gaming may not be too far away there because of the immersion it offers it kind of meats that product market felt but for a general purpose computing device I think we used to
00:04:35-00:05:08 Speaker 0: to live a life to go to send a said that for doubles aren't really the end destination but that small bones are here to stay as people's main devices which I agree live we've developed such deep habits with our small friends there's gonna be really hard for any new piece of tack to replace them but then what is the future of votes okay so I right eye is a huge part of this picture now I was watching Google announce the magic editor and I literally I got response watching I thought it was incredible and I'm so excited about it at the same time it does maybe think has any part of you worry about the inauthenticity with photos at that point which is
00:05:08-00:05:49 Speaker 1: why I think it's important in the context of Google photo this is designed for I didn't quite get this right maybe there was an awkward bag in the middle let me brush it all up its to create memories it's a good question where is the line yeah which is why when we talk but public images at large you're also talking about watermarking meta-data making sure the world understand something is ai generating today you're always in your personal life if someone is coming you like quick adjusting the living room to make it night is that authentic or not right you care about those things and so I think you were skipping people the power to do that in the context of their digital memories but you are right I think there is a cantonal in these things I trust people
00:05:49-00:06:25 Speaker 0: to figure this out there's a lot of talk about kind of doing this responsibly and I think it's totally right to take it slow and not rush to the and pointing to do that one of the things that I worry about is not even the fact that this ai can fall into the hands of that actors but it's more just about that even in the best case situation if ai does really well and it does exactly what we're trying to make it do then what happens to us as humans every kids born into the world except every bit of technology that exists at a time when they were born so a kid being born into the world of ai where they can have an essays written for them have their emails which involvement what do they do in their life like what are they we will always
00:06:25-00:07:15 Speaker 1: worried as humanity about every new technology currently calculators have the meat kids forset math or better or borrowers' humans are incredibly resourceful creative resilient and and they adopt eye is definitely powerful technology you know once said die as the most profound technology humanity is working on and more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we have done in the past so I understand the sentiment behind the question I wonder about the same question all the time but I think done correctly can liberate you to channel whatever you want to do and your powerful tools to enable you to do that how we find meaning the minnies are deep questions I think we will value and cherish those human experiences if you're a doctor you're spending a lot of time doing everything out of I'm actually spending time with the patient and talking as it free you are so that your time
00:07:15-00:07:36 Speaker 0: time is more spent on those moments it's a very hard line isn't it but ai is developing very quickly it almost feels like we're chasing after it like trying to keep on top of it I guess I worry that a school curriculum for example can very easily factor in the calculated exist by just making calculated Papus how does the school factor in the people can self right there SMEs how the tools keep up about well you know you could imagine
00:07:36-00:08:15 Speaker 1: maybe a teacher is judging people by getting them together in a class and asking them to discuss a topic like those are all on our patients that are possible these questions were asked about Google search the fact you can find anything online like what does it mean to have that information I watch YouTube all the time to learn on any topic that exists in the world I would think that's a good thing you're now making this accessible to pretty much everyone on the world and I think that's good but your point about the pace of change being very fast I think that's real and you have to give time for society to adapt to it and that's going to be the tension as the make progress in more sure send us definitely a tech optimist but I do agree with this point even though there are a million ways that
00:08:15-00:08:24 Speaker 0: I could cause societal problems are best chance of avoiding that is to take our time developing it I've got a few rapid-fire questions and finish off what found is I know it's
00:08:24-00:08:46 Speaker 1: the picks of seven proll but that from testing I I I use everything from a Sam some galaxy to the new pixel fall to the eye on your fingers all over the place I just have extra numbers to the dead light modal dockman defense I love dark board but then I occasionally miss being in life more I switch back then I go back and full-time still on the fence okay but dark more on the average
00:08:46-00:09:03 Speaker 0: you ought to take between a bigger battery and a better camera better camera white a while discharging why less charge you okay you find it more convenient you know okay it's kind of a joke semi-serious there's curranty a petition right now to make me one of the voices
00:09:03-00:09:17 Speaker 1: of people assistant where can I hand my wrist Hey I was hard to say you should hand it to board but you can you can send it to me the answer to this to me later so we can start this helps no good voice it may work out
